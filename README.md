# Jammin

This app is created with React as a codecademy tutorialproject.
It allows the user to search for songs with the spotify-API, add them to a playlist and save it to their account.

Instead of using class components like the course teaches i went with using functional components and hooks for practice.
I also used git (obviously) for version control in order to become more comfortable with the system.
